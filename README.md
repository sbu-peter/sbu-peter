- 👋 Hi, I’m @sbu-peter
- 👀 I’m interested in in programming especially web and mobile applications development. Also to sharpen my skills on JavaScript (libraries and frameworks).
- My experience is based on JavaScript and PHP. I did VB and a bit of Java mobile development during my studies with the University of South Africa.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Jquery and JSON to be followed by React Native and Node.js.
- intending to learn Python, C# and improve on Java.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any JavaScript/PHP projects, this will enhance my skills and exposure into the libraries and frameworks.
- 📫 Please reach me on my email sbusisosk1@gmail.com
