- 👋 Hi, I’m @sbu-peter
- 👀 I’m interested in in programming especially web and mobile applications development. Also to sharpen my skills on JavaScript (libraries and frameworks).
- 🌱 I’m currently intending to learn Python, C# and improve on Java.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any JavaScript projects, this will enhance my skills and exposure into the libraries and frameworks.
